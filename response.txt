Key differences in trends  between Europe and North America
The key differences between Europe and North America regarding long-term trends in attacks on public surface transportation are as follows:

1. **Frequency of Attacks:**
   - In Europe, attacks on trains and buses have been increasing since 1970, even though they remain fewer compared to regions like South Asia. Europe, with 10.6% of global attacks, sees more frequent incidents compared to North America.
   - In contrast, North America has experienced far fewer attacks, with only 12 in the United States and four in Canada from 1970 to the present.

2. **Lethality and Trends:**
   - European attacks exhibit a decrease in overall lethality, with a significant disparity between the number of incidents and those with fatalities. This indicates more low-level attacks in Europe with decreasing lethality over time.
   - In North America, there have been very few fatal attacks, suggesting a lower overall threat level compared to Europe.

3. **Nature of Threats:**
   - European attackers include both low-lethality groups such as anarchists and high-lethality groups like jihadists. Jihadist attacks account for 50% of all fatalities in Europe with a focus on achieving high body counts.
   - North America has seen fewer jihadist attacks and more threats from isolated incidents, such as the 1993 Long Island commuter train shooting by a mentally disturbed individual.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - The thwarting of multiple plots in Europe suggests strong security measures and intelligence successes but also a persistent threat aimed at high casualties.
   - In North America, the increase in thwarted plots could imply either strong security effectiveness or plotters lacking the capability to execute their plans.

Overall, Europe experiences more frequent attacks with varied lethality and threat types, whereas North America has fewer incidents but remains vigilant against growing plots.
